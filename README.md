# Firefox full chain exploit for CVE-2019-11708 + CVE-2019-9810

Targets [Firefox 66.0 x64](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/66.0/win64/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%2066.0.exe) instead of a custom build of Firefox like in the [original PoC.](https://github.com/0vercl0k/CVE-2019-11708)

# Changes from the original PoC:

* Moved away from the use of "BigInt" since it was an test feature at the time and was not enabled by default. 

* Adjusted offsets for Release build 66.0

* Removed unused code

* Executes after the OnLoad event fires.
